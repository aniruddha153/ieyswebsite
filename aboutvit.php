        <p>Spread over 300 acres, VIT University is strategically located at the crossroads of Chennai and Bangalore. It houses over 22,000 students from all across the globe, pursuing a broad array of disciplines from engineering and management background, all consolidated into nine schools of excellence.</p>

<p>Internationalization of the university started with the admission of foreign students followed by the signing of international MoUs. VIT has a unique combination of pioneering research and top class education with an innovative curriculum called "Fully Flexible Credit System" that gives students the flexibility in choosing their courses, faculty and even their class hours! Thus the institute supports inter-disciplinary interaction which encourages a seamless flow of knowledge within the institute. The undergraduate students also get a chance to participate in the on-going research projects of the university or start their own research work under the courses URE 001, URE 002, URE 003 and URE 004.Thus a vibrant undergraduate programme co-exists with an extremely industrious post-graduate programme.</p>

<p>VITians have created placement records time and again, with the most recent one being Cognizant that placed 1920 students in campus recruitment. An unfettered spirit of exploration, rationality and enterprise thrives in the campus with the faculty being extremely supportive, highly qualified and student friendly. The chancellor, Dr. G. Viswanathan was recently awarded the lifetime achievement award for the phenomenal reforms he has brought about in higher education. Two major fests hosted by VIT annually are - Riviera, a Sports and Cultural carnival and GraVITas, a knowledge carnival inviting participation from a multitude of international universities.VIT is known for an excellent world-class infrastructure with a broad spectrum of modern technologies, highly equipped laboratories, research centres and a Central library built to International standards.</p>

<p>Programmes at VIT are accredited by National and International agencies such as NBA, NAAC, IET (UK), Energy Institute (UK). Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) of the USA has accredited the Civil, Mechanical, Electronics & Communication and Computer Science undergraduate programmes. There are several other honours and awards to VIT's credit making it one among the best private institutions in India with global recognition.
